			<h2>HTML5 boilerplate</h2>

			<p>Last week I read this great article by an Ivan Vasilev. He covered the topic of deep learning starting from the foundations of linear classification. It is a bit of a lengthy read but the page went a long way to helping me understand how deep learning works.</p>

			<p>What I do cover here will be an extreme oversimplification, and I would recommend anyone that is interested to read the original article. In short a very simple linear classification algorithm can do good work but will frequently fall shorter than other choices. A neural network can learn more powerful classes but needs to be hand tuned for feed forward networks or trained with back-propogation. The large drawback of back-propogation is that with larger numbers of layers the effect of the backprop diminishes the further back you go.</p>

			<p>One solution that can be used for this type of problem is autoencoders. An autoencoder is a type of feed forward network that attempts to learn a compressed form of the input. With that comes the potential of learning higher level features. If you continue this several layers to build a stacked autoencoder then you can use this compressed and higher level version of your input to train your output. Thus, hopefully, getting a perceptron that has a more useful understanding of your data.</p>

			<p>What really interests me here is the potential to use the computer to build up important sets of features without human assistance. I am a bit proponent of makeing the computer do anything that you can since computer time is much cheaper than human time. I also don't want to spend my ambitions to explore the realms of machine learning on hand building feature sets for my work. I would rather gather up data and tell the computer to run with it. Even if a large amount of patience goes to waiting for the computer to digest everything I could then spend the waiting period working on other things or theorizing what I would like to do when I get my data.</p>

			<p>In the mean time it looks like deep learning just might get thrown onto the heap of things that I will work on. I can't wait to see where this goes.</p>
